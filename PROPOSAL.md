<h1>Project Proposal</h1>

<h2>Project choice: Matching Game</h2>

<h3>Project description</h3>

Welcome to Matchem, an online single-player game designed to challenge memory recall skills.
Players must strategically match identical icons on a board without exceeding a set number of turns. 
After completing each board, the game displays the player's score, determined by both the time taken and the number of turns used. 
Additionally, the game offers a board restart option to encourage players to aim for higher scores. 
Future plans include expanding the game with different board sizes and implementing a top scores log for each size, enhancing the competitive aspect of the gameplay.
